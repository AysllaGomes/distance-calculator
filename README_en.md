# Travel Calculation Project

This project is an API for calculating details of a trip, including travel time, fuel cost, carbon emissions, and weather conditions along the route.

## Features

- Calculate distance and travel time between two locations.
- Calculate fuel cost for the trip.
- Calculate carbon emissions for the trip based on fuel type.
- Obtain weather conditions at the origin and destination points.

## Technologies Used

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps)
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/)
